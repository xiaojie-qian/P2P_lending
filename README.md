## Backgroud information 
Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company provides the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform, where borrowers can obtain unsecured personal loans between $1,000 and $40,000, and investors can purchase notes backed by payments made on loans. Investors can search and browse the loan listings on the Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. Investors make money from interest. Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee. Lending Club went public in the year 2014 (stock symbol LC). As of February 2016, it has a market capitalization of about 2.5 billion dollars.

Lending Club offers investors a way to earn financial returns much higher than alternative investments such as savings accounts. Its web advertisement promises a return of 5-7%; However, investors are also exposed to the risk that some borrowers default on their loans. A fundamentally important problem for investors is to understand the quality of loans. Will a particular loan default? How much loss will be incurred in a given loan portfolio? Investors who can answer those questions well are able to choose better loan portfolios to invest in and dramatically reduce their risk exposure.
